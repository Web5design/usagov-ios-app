USA.gov for iOS mobile application
=============

The USA.gov iOS mobile application allows you to:

* Search tens of millions of web pages from federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments and to contact your government by phone or email.
* Find quality images from U.S. government web sites
* Search product recalls across several government agencies
* Visit the USA.gov blog
* Contact USA.gov

By releasing the source code for this app we hope to empower other governments and organizations to build and release mobile apps to engage the general public and their own specific constituencies. In addition, public review and contribution to the application's code base will help strengthen and improve the app.

Requirements to run the iOS mobile application
----------------------------------------------

1. iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch iOS version 4.3 or later
2. JSON feeds for content to be aggregated and displayed by the app

Working with the Source Code
----------------------------

Mobile developers will be able to configure the application to retrieve and display content from arbitrary USA Search and Recalls JSON feeds. Assets may be replaced to customize the app's look and feel.

Building the app requires the iOS 4.3 SDK or higher.

This app makes use of several libraries in source, binary, and submodule form.

The following sections describe all of the libraries and any steps necessary to initialize them.

### Included Libraries

The following libraries are directly included as source code:

1. YAJL
2. JSON

### Search Functionality
Search functionality relies on USASearch, a hosted search service provided by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government websites may use this service at no cost. For details on incorporating USASearch into .Gov sites, or for examples of the API and how it functions, see the [USASearch website](http://usasearch.howto.gov/) and the [USASearch API documentation](http://usasearch.howto.gov/manual/api.html), respectively.

NOTE: Setting up the application and configuring it for use in your organization's context requires iOS development experience. The application ships with a similar design to what is used in the USA.gov for iOS mobile application.
